## Overview
The task is to create a solution for QR-Code page as per Frontend Mentor specifications. The idea behind is to use the newly acquired
skills based on newbie HTML, CSS and particurlarly Flexbox concepts.
### Screenshot

![](./images/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned
How to apply flexbox to body element if the content needs to be centered and works well for card like designs.

The goal is to move to junior frontend HTML/CSS developer.
