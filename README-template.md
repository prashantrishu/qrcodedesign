## Overview
The task is to create a solution for QR-Code page as per Frontend Mentor specifications. The idea behind is to use the newly acquired
skills based on newbie HTML, CSS and particurlarly Flexbox concepts.
### Screenshot

![](./imges/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned
How to apply flexbox to body element if the content needs to be centered and works well for card like designs.

### Continued development

I need to continue working on newbie projects untill I do lots of projects and I do not loose my learning after a period of time.
The goal is to move to junior frontend HTML/CSS developer.


### Useful resources
